## Mall Customer Spending Score Prediction using K Means Clustering

## Overview

Welcome to the Mall Customer Spending Score Prediction project repository! This unique project combines K Means Clustering and predictive modeling to estimate the spending score of mall customers based on their annual income. The dataset includes essential information about each customer, such as CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100).

## Methodology

### K Means Clustering for Segmentation

The initial phase of the project employs K Means Clustering to segment customers based on their overall characteristics. The steps include:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Understand customer demographics and behavior through exploratory data analysis.

2. **K Means Clustering:**
   - Utilize K Means Clustering to categorize customers into distinct segments based on features like age, gender, and spending score.

3. **Segment Analysis:**
   - Examine the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into the different customer segments.

### Predictive Modeling

The second phase focuses on predicting the spending score using annual income. The steps involve:

1. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identify relevant features, with a specific focus on annual income for prediction.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Prepare the data for predictive modeling, addressing any missing values or outliers.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Implement machine learning techniques, possibly regression models, to train the model on historical data.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess the predictive model's performance, ensuring accuracy in estimating spending scores.

## Project Details

### Dataset Columns

- **CustomerID:** Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Genre:** Gender of the customer (e.g., Male or Female).
- **Age:** Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$):** Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars (used for prediction).
- **Spending Score (1-100):** The target variable representing the spending score assigned to the customer.
